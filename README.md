# Vernon Museum and Archives Exhibit Website

This website was developed for the Greater Vernon Museum and Archives to provide a virtual exhibit website, separate from their <a href="https://vernonmuseum.ca/">main wordpress website</a>. The following documentation is for developers that may work on the project in the future, it is not a manual for end-users.

This documentation needs to be rewritten to match the new API and the implementation of web services.
